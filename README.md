Comment (module for Omeka S)
============================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Comment] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows users and/or public to comment
resources. It includes both ReCaptchas and Akismet spam detection if needed.
Comments can be flagged and moderated.

Comment can be displayed in public view or not, allowing librarian to comment
the resource themselves, publicly or privately.

With the module [Guest], the user can see its own comments and subscribe to
resources to be notified when a comment is added.


Installation
------------

### Module

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

This module requires the module [Common], that should be installed first.
The optional module [Blocks Disposition] may be installed too for old themes.

The optional module [Guest] can be used to manage own comments.

* From the zip

Download the last release [Comment.zip] from the list of releases, and
uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `Comment`.

Then install it like any other Omeka module and follow the config instructions.

* Askimet

Note: Akismet requires a dependency that is not installed automatically.


Displaying Comments
-------------------

The comments are displayed automatically on item set, item or media pages
according to options set in site settings. They can be added to resource pages
via the resource blocks too.

To manage the display more precisely, use resource blocks or the module
[Blocks Disposition], or add the following code in your theme:

```php
<?php // Or via the helpers. ?>
<div id="comments-container" class="block block-comments-container">
    <?= $this->commentsResource($resource) ?>
    <?= $this->commentForm($resource) ?>
</div>

<?php // Via a standard partial. ?>
<?= $this->partial('common/comment', ['resource' => $resource]) ?>
```

The structure of comments, the comment itself, and the comment form can be
themed.

In the admin board, the comments are available in the details of the browse
pages and in the show pages of each resource. They can be filtered and managed
in the main comment page.


Email Notifications
-------------------

The module provides two types of email notifications:

### Subscriber notifications

Users can subscribe to resources to be notified when new comments are published.
When a logged-in user posts a comment, they are automatically subscribed to that
resource. When a comment is approved (published), all subscribers to that resource
receive an email notification. Subscribers are notified when:

- A new comment is created and immediately approved (no moderation required)
- An existing comment is approved by a moderator

Subscribers are *not* notified for comments pending moderation.

### Moderator notifications

Moderators can be notified by email when comments require attention. To enable
this, add one or more email addresses in the main settings under "Notify public
comments by email" (one email per line).

Moderators are notified when:

| Event                                      | Notification sent |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| New comment created (approved or pending)  | Yes               |
| Comment edited by user                     | Yes               |
| Comment flagged by user                    | Yes               |

The flagged comment notification includes:
- Resource ID and title
- Comment author name and email
- Full comment body
- Direct link to the admin review page

### Customizing email templates

All email subjects and bodies can be customized in the main settings. Each email
type has configurable subject and body fields with placeholder support:

Subscriber notification (sent to users who subscribed to a resource):
- Placeholders: `{site_name}`, `{resource_id}`, `{resource_title}`, `{resource_url}`, `{comment_author}`, `{comment_body}`

Moderator notification (sent when a comment is created or edited):
- Placeholders: `{site_name}`, `{resource_id}`, `{resource_title}`, `{resource_url}`, `{comment_author}`, `{comment_email}`, `{comment_body}`

Flagged comment notification (sent when a comment is flagged):
- Placeholders: `{site_name}`, `{resource_id}`, `{resource_title}`, `{comment_author}`, `{comment_email}`, `{comment_body}`, `{admin_url}`

If a template field is left empty, the default template is used.


Comment History
---------------

All changes to comments are tracked in a history log. The following actions are
recorded:

| Action      | Data stored                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `edit`      | Previous body content          |
| `approve`   | -                              |
| `unapprove` | -                              |
| `flag`      | -                              |
| `unflag`    | -                              |
| `spam`      | -                              |
| `unspam`    | -                              |

Each history entry includes:
- Action type
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
- User ID (who performed the action)
- Additional data (when applicable)

The history is available via the API (`o:history`) and can be used to review
changes or restore previous versions of a comment.


Options
-------

The comment module makes use of both ReCaptchas and the Akismet spam-detection
service. You will want to get API keys to both of these services and add them to
Omeka S main configuration for ReCaptchas key on inside the main settings page.

If not enabled, a simple anti-spam is available too.

### Rate limiting

To prevent spam and abuse, a rate limiting feature is available. Configure it in
the main settings:

- Max comments: Maximum number of comments allowed per IP address within the
  time period (set to 0 to disable)
- Period (minutes): Time window for the rate limit

When the limit is exceeded, users receive a "Too many comments" error and must
wait before posting again.

### Alias mode

Logged-in users can optionally comment using an alias (custom name and email)
instead of their account information. This feature is disabled by default. To
enable it, go to main settings and enable "Allow users to comment with an alias".

When enabled, users see a choice when posting a comment:
- Account: Uses their registered name and email
- Use an alias: Allows entering a custom name and email

The comment remains linked to the user's account (visible to administrators),
but the displayed name and email are the custom values. This is useful for users
who want to comment under a pseudonym while still being accountable.

Note: The alias name and email are stored with each comment independently, so
changing the user's account information later does not affect existing comments.

### Anonymous mode

Logged-in users can optionally comment anonymously. This feature is disabled by
default. To enable it, go to main settings and enable "Allow users to comment
anonymously"

When enabled, users see an additional option when posting a comment:
- Account: Uses their registered name and email
- Comment anonymously: Displays "[Anonymous]" as the author name

The comment remains linked to the user's account for moderation purposes (visible
to administrators), but the public display shows "[Anonymous]" instead of the
user's name. The email is not stored with the comment.

Both alias mode and anonymous mode can be enabled simultaneously, giving users
three options: account, alias, or anonymous.


Use Cases
---------

### Limited, moderated commenting

An institution wants only trusted people to leave comments for anyone to read.
It doesn’t trust some of them enough to allow comments to be automatically
public.

The comments can be moderated by the global admin, the site admin, the editor or
the reviewer.

### Open commenting, with registered users getting to submit comments without approval

Install and configure the [Guest] module. Set commenting to Public so that
anyone can comment.

### Closed commenting for resources management

It’s possible to comment resources internally, for example to improve the
quality of metadata, or in a discussion between an author and a reviewer.

### Groups

To manage comments, you may add groups with item sets in settings.
For better urls, you may add a redirection with module [Redirector].


TODO
----

- [x] Move some parameters from main settings to site settings.
- [x] Add comment edit history tracking.
- [x] Add rate limiting for spam prevention.
- [x] Add alias mode for logged-in users.
- [x] Add anonymous mode for logged-in users.
- [ ] Use PrepareMessage from module Common for email templates.
- [ ] Convert comment into annotations (module Annotate).
- [ ] Manage comments with module Guest.
- [ ] Manage comments on site pages.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
